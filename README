Comienzo

Comienzo was started off of Elliot Jay Stock fabulous theme Starkers. I continually found myself adding items to WP themes I built so decided to build a continually evolving base them for WP. Comienzo includes many classes and id's that I use to build a Wordpress theme. I have found that generally I don't have to touch the HTML to implement a design.

I'm happy to take suggestions via tickets submitted to Github. I won't be responding to any emails or comments on blog posts regarding this theme. Just keeps things centralized and tracked for me.

Thanks for checking this out and good luck.
