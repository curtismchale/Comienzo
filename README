Comienzo

Comienzo is intended to be a blank starting theme that follows WordPress best practices. There are few/no styles and lots of empty classes that you should fill in. There are a few helper functions that I use regularly but by and large it's simply a clean starting place for building solid WordPress themes.

I'm happy to take suggestions via tickets submitted to Github. I won't be responding to any emails or comments on blog posts regarding this theme. Just keeps things centralized and tracked for me.

Thanks for checking this out and good luck.

THANKS

Many thanks to @iKitty for help with the name (I don't speak Spanish).
Thanks to Elliot Jay Stocks who built Starkers which I used for a long time and was the base for this theme many moons ago.

----------
INSTALLATION

To install upload Comienzo to your /wp-content/themes directory. Change theme folder name as appropriate as well as theme attribution and title in the CSS file.

----------
License

Comienzo is a GPL theme which means you can use it as you wish without restriction. Enjoy.

Of course a link to my site is always appreciated.
