Comienzo

Comienzo was started off of Elliot Jay Stocks fabulous theme Starkers. I continually found myself adding items to WP themes I built so decided to build a continually evolving base them for WP. Comienzo includes many classes and id's that I use to build a Wordpress theme. I have found that generally I don't have to touch the HTML to implement a design.

I'm happy to take suggestions via tickets submitted to Github. I won't be responding to any emails or comments on blog posts regarding this theme. Just keeps things centralized and tracked for me.

Thanks for checking this out and good luck.

View the theme at http://comienzo.curtisdev.ca though it's really not much to look at.
